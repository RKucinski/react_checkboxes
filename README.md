## Welcome visitor

Here you will find a React page to work checkboxes and filtered content from Swapi API (hope it did not went down when you'll read this)

I also added some global state management with Context. Even if I'm currently more used to Redux, the Context API might fit better to some projects. So I gave it a try.

It's a over-documented (too much) code for the reviewer, so don't mind about it :)
